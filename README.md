What?
A driverless bus that moves independently, following a predetermined route and stops at the appropriate bus stations. 

Why?
Foolproof, self-driving vehicles are statistically much safer than human drivers.  NHTSA statistics show that 94% of car accidents are caused by human error.  This technology applied in public transport should negate the need for personal vehicles, and consequently reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

How?
1. Design a path for the car to follow
2. Program the car to be autonomous
3. Assign dedicated stops along the path
4. Obstacle avoidance
5. UI that allows the user to interact with the car
